🐾 Animal Management System (Java OOP)
📖 Description
This project is a practical implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. It models a system to categorize and manage different animal species using inheritance and custom logic.

🛠️ Technical Features

Inheritance & Polymorphism: Utilizes a parent Animal class and a specialized Fish subclass to demonstrate code reusability.


Interfaces: Implemented the Comparable interface to enable automated sorting of objects based on specific attributes like name.

Custom Exception Handling: Developed NameTooLongException to ensure data integrity and validate user input length.

Encapsulation: Used private fields with public getters and setters to protect data within the classes.

Data Structures: Integrated ArrayList and Enums to manage and categorize collections of animal data efficiently.
