# Object-Oriented-Programming-Java
🎓 Java Coursework & Labs
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Java lab assignments completed as part of my Computer Science Engineering studies at the University of Debrecen. These projects are designed to demonstrate a strong foundation in software engineering principles and programmatic problem-solving.

🚀 Key Focus Areas
💻 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Implementation of Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Abstraction.

📂 Data Structures: Working with Arrays, Lists, and custom data types to manage information efficiently.

🧠 Algorithmic Logic: Developing efficient solutions for computational problems and logic-based tasks.

🛠️ Best Practices: Writing clean, documented, and maintainable Java code.

📁 Structure
Each folder represents a specific lab or module, containing the source code and a brief description of the task requirements.
